# Rust made snake game

A Snake game written with Rust and piston library!

## How to run

**Note:** You need to have rust and cargo installed in your terminal or command line.

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ErfunEb/snake-rs.git
```

After cloning the repo, go to the `snake-rs` directory:

```sh
cd snake-rs
```

At the end, run the following command for build and run:

```sh
cargo build
target/debug/server # this is the executable created after build
```

Or alternatively, instead of build and manually run the executable, you can run the following command:

```sh
cargo run
```
